    <h2>
        Pancake numbers:
    </h2>
    <p>Imagine you have a stack of pancakes. They are of varying sizes and are randomly arranged in a stack. You need to arrange it into a stack of biggest to smallest. You can only flip from the top. The number of flips required in the worst case is the pancake number. Interestingly, there is still no formula to find pancake numbers.</p>

        Perfect numbers:
    </h2>
    <p>
        A perfect number is the sum of its divisors. For example, 6 is 3+2+1. There are very few perfect numbers that exist.
